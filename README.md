# Video Presenter

Video presenter's main aim was to allow me to present videos I've made in manim as a presentation

Using a normal video player the video will play and you have to manually pause it, this is not only a bit annoying but the mouse shows and normally the UI pops up

Using this application the mouse is hidden and, using the .flag file, the program will automatically pause at flagged points in the video
